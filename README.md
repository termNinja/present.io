# present.io

I really got tired of setting up my pandoc-beamer based presentations every time,
so I decided to create a helper script to setup everything for me. Please note
this is an early early version that is created for my private needs. In the future
I plan to code it properly, add proper command line arguments and publish it as
a Python package.
